# Emotion Detection System

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from  **facial cues** using machine learning techniques.  
The system extracts features from voice samples and facial expressions, then classifies emotions such as *happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprised,* etc.  

It is intended for use in sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and intelligent assistant systems.

## Features
- Emotion recognition from **images/video frames**
- Facial feature extraction with CNN-based models
- Multi-class emotion classification

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (image preprocessing)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (deep learning models)
